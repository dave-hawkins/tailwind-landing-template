# Tailwind landing page

An open source TailwindCSS landing page template.

This project was scaffolded with [create-vite](https://vitejs.dev/guide/) but the entirety of the code is available in the `index.html` file, and was designed to slot easily into any default Tailwind project.

Note
I am more designer than developer and this is the first thing I've ever properly open sourced, please feel free to suggest changes, and call out any mistakes that have been made.
